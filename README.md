‚ö†Ô∏è  This is an unofficial application and is not affiliated with Yandex or its services.

## Why?

-   Because I just want to run `app.exe` and get my tracks. No `apt`, no `brew`, no `pip`, and none of that other annoying stuff
-   It's fun to code new things ü§ó

## Features

-   Modern graphical user interface
-   _Blazingly fast, powered by the Go programming language_
-   Download individual tracks and playlists in MP3 format
-   Duplicate detection in playlists
-   Concurrent file downloads

## Installation

-   Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/Stmol/yandex-music-downloader/releases)
-   Select the appropriate binary for your operating system
-   Extract the archive to any directory you prefer
-   For Linux and macOS, make the binary executable: `chmod +x yamdl`
-   Launch the application from the terminal: `./yamdl`

## Authentication Token

An OAuth token is required for accessing certain tracks and playlists.

üîê Without a token, you will be able to download only 30 seconds of each track.

For detailed instructions on how to obtain your token, refer to this [page](https://yandex-music.readthedocs.io/en/main/token.html).

## Usage Guide

### 1. Token Authentication

-   On the first launch, you'll be prompted to enter your [authentication token](#authentication-token)
-   You may proceed without a token by pressing `Enter`, but this may result in errors while downloading

### 2. Token Persistence

-   After entering the token, you'll have the option to save it to `token.txt` in the application directory
-   This eliminates the need to re-enter the token on subsequent launches

### 3. Copy Track Link

-   Navigate to the Yandex Music web interface and select `Share` -> `Copy link` for any track or playlist
-   This will copy the URL to your clipboard
